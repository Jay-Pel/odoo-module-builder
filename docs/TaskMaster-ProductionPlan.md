## SPRINT BREAKDOWN

## SPRINT 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation & Core Infrastructure

### User Stories:

#### US-1.1: User Registration & Authentication
**As a** potential customer, **I want to** create an account and log in securely **so that** I can access the module builder platform.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: FastAPI, Cloudflare D1, `passlib` for hashing, JWT.
- **Backend Steps**:
  1.  Create `users` table in D1: `id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY), email (TEXT UNIQUE), hashed_password (TEXT), created_at (TEXT)`.
  2.  In a `auth.py` service, use `passlib.context.CryptContext` for password hashing.
  3.  Create `/auth/register` endpoint: hashes password, stores new user in D1.
  4.  Create `/auth/login` endpoint: verifies credentials, returns a JWT access token.
  5.  Create a FastAPI dependency to verify JWTs on protected endpoints, extracting user ID from the token.
- **Frontend Steps**:
  1.  Create responsive Login and Registration pages with forms. Use `react-hook-form` for validation.
  2.  On successful login, store the JWT securely in an `HttpOnly` cookie.
  3.  Use an Axios interceptor or similar to send credentials with every API request.

#### US-1.2: Payment Integration Setup
**As a** platform owner, **I want to** integrate Stripe payment processing **so that** users can pay for their modules.
**Effort:** 13 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Stripe SDK (`stripe` for Python, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`).
- **Backend Steps**:
  1.  Add Stripe API keys as secrets using `wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.
  2.  Create `/payments/create-payment-intent` endpoint. It receives an amount and returns a `client_secret` from Stripe.
  3.  Create `/payments/stripe-webhook` endpoint to listen for Stripe events (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`).
  4.  **Crucial**: Secure the webhook by verifying the `Stripe-Signature` header. The webhook updates the project's payment status in the database.
- **Frontend Steps**:
  1.  Wrap the payment form with `<Elements>` provider from Stripe.
  2.  Use `useStripe` and `useElements` hooks and the `PaymentElement` for a secure, pre-built payment form.
  3.  Confirm the payment using the `client_secret` from the backend.

#### US-1.3: Database Schema Design
**As a** developer, **I want to** design the core database schema **so that** all user data and module projects are properly stored.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-compatible SQL).
- **SQL Schema**:
  ```sql
  -- Run with 'wrangler d1 execute <DB_NAME> --file=schema.sql'
  CREATE TABLE users (
      id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      hashed_password TEXT NOT NULL,
      created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  CREATE TABLE projects (
      id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
      name TEXT NOT NULL,
      odoo_version INTEGER NOT NULL,
      status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft', -- draft, generating, testing, uat, completed
      created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
  );
  CREATE TABLE specifications (
      id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      project_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      content TEXT,
      is_approved INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- boolean
      created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects (id)
  );
  -- etc. for payments, module_versions...
  ```

#### US-1.4: Basic API Framework
**As a** developer, **I want to** set up the core API framework **so that** frontend and AI agents can communicate effectively.
**Effort:** 5 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: FastAPI, `wrangler` for deployment.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Project Structure: `main.py`, `/routers` (for different resources), `/services`, `/models` (for Pydantic schemas).
  2.  In `main.py`, create the FastAPI app instance and add `CORSMiddleware` to allow requests from your frontend's domain.
  3.  Deploying Python to Cloudflare Workers: Use the `--build-command` and `--entrypoint` flags in `wrangler.toml` to set up a Python environment.
  4.  Create a simple `/health` endpoint that returns `{"status": "ok"}` to verify deployment.

#### US-1.5: CloudFlare Infrastructure Setup
**As a** platform owner, **I want to** deploy the application on CloudFlare **so that** it's fast, secure, and cost-effective.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: `wrangler` CLI, Cloudflare Dashboard.
- **Steps**:
  1.  **Frontend**: Create a new Cloudflare Pages project and link it to your GitHub repository's main branch. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `dist`.
  2.  **Backend**: Use `wrangler init` to create a `wrangler.toml` file. Configure it for your Worker.
  3.  **Database**: Run `wrangler d1 create <DB_NAME>`. Add the binding to your `wrangler.toml` file so the Worker can access it.
  4.  **Storage**: Run `wrangler r2 bucket create <BUCKET_NAME>`. Add the R2 binding to `wrangler.toml`.
  5.  Set up a custom domain for Pages and Workers in the Cloudflare dashboard.

## SPRINT 2 (Weeks 3-4): Specification Agent & UI Foundation

### User Stories:

#### US-2.1: Specification Agent Service
**As a** user, **I want to** generate detailed module specifications using AI **so that** I can clearly define what my module should do.
**Effort:** 13 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: `google-generativeai` Python library, FastAPI.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Store your Gemini API key as a Worker secret: `wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY`.
  2.  Create a `/specifications/generate` endpoint that accepts a project ID and user prompt.
  3.  The service fetches the project details.
  4.  It constructs a detailed prompt using the template from `Prompt.md` and the user's input.
  5.  It calls the Gemini 1.5 Flash model, streams the response, and saves the final markdown to the `specifications` table.
  6.  Use Pydantic models for request and response validation.

#### US-2.2: Module Requirements Input Form
**As a** user, **I want to** input my module requirements through a guided form **so that** the AI can understand what I need.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: React, `react-hook-form`, Tailwind CSS.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Create a multi-step form (wizard) component.
  2.  Use simple, accessible input components from a library like Headless UI, styled with Tailwind.
  3.  Use `react-hook-form` to manage form state and validation (e.g., module name is required, version must be selected).
  4.  On final submission, call the backend to first create the project, then trigger specification generation.

#### US-2.3: Specification Editor Interface
**As a** user, **I want to** view and edit the generated specification **so that** I can ensure it meets my exact needs.
**Effort:** 13 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: React, `react-markdown` for preview.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Create a page to display the specification. Fetch the markdown content from your API.
  2.  Use `react-markdown` with the `remark-gfm` plugin to render it beautifully as HTML.
  3.  Add an "Edit" button. When clicked, toggle the view to show a simple `<textarea>` prepopulated with the markdown content.
  4.  Implement "Save" (sends a `PUT` request) and "Cancel" buttons.
  5.  The "Approve" button should trigger a modal asking for final confirmation before sending an `approve` request to the API.

#### US-2.4: Basic Frontend Framework
**As a** user, **I want to** access a modern, responsive web interface **so that** I can easily navigate the platform.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: React (Vite), `react-router-dom`, Tailwind CSS.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Initialize the project: `npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts`.
  2.  Install and configure Tailwind CSS by following its official guide for Vite.
  3.  Set up routes using `react-router-dom`: define routes for home, login, dashboard, project pages, etc.
  4.  Create a shared `Layout` component with a header (with navigation) and a footer.
  5.  For loading states, use a simple library like `react-spinners`. Note that the Three.js idea is a "stretch goal" for later enhancement.

#### US-2.5: Project Management System
**As a** user, **I want to** save and manage my module projects **so that** I can work on multiple modules over time.
**Effort:** 5 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: React Query (TanStack Query), FastAPI.
- **Backend Steps**:
  1.  Implement full CRUD endpoints for `/projects`. Ensure all endpoints are protected and only allow users to access their own projects.
- **Frontend Steps**:
  1.  Use React Query for data fetching, caching, and state management. It simplifies loading/error states.
  2.  Create a `Dashboard` page that uses the `useQuery` hook to fetch and display a list of the user's projects.
  3.  Each project in the list should be a link (`<Link to={`/project/${project.id}`}>`) to its detail page.

---

## SPRINT 3 (Weeks 5-6): Coding Agent & Module Generation

### User Stories:

#### US-3.1: Coding Agent Service
**As a** user, **I want to** automatically generate Odoo module code from my specification **so that** I don't have to write the code manually.
**Effort:** 21 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Anthropic SDK, FastAPI, Cloudflare R2.
- **Strategy**: The agent will perform a multi-step process to generate and refine the code, ultimately returning a single JSON object where keys are file paths and values are the code content.
- **Backend Steps**:
  1.  Add Anthropic API key as a secret: `wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
  2.  Create an async endpoint `/coding/generate-module/{project_id}`. This starts a background task.
  3.  **Step 1: First Draft Generation**: The background task reads the approved specification from D1 and the Odoo development guidelines file (`odoo_guidelines.md`). It sends a detailed prompt to Claude 3 Sonnet, instructing it to generate the complete Odoo module as a single JSON string based on the spec and guidelines.
  4.  **Step 2: Self-Correction & Refinement**:
      *   The agent receives the first-draft JSON.
      *   It then makes a **second call** to Claude 3 Sonnet. The prompt for this call includes the generated code.
      *   **Refinement Prompt**: "You are a senior Odoo architect. Review the following Odoo module code. Ensure it is fully compliant with the Odoo development guidelines, functionally correct according to the user's specification, and optimized for performance and maintainability. Remove any unnecessary files or code. Refactor where needed. Return the final, production-ready module code in the exact same JSON format."
  5.  **Step 3: Packaging and Storage**: Once the final, refined JSON is received, parse it. In a loop, create a zip file in memory, adding each file from the JSON object.
  6.  Upload the final zip file to Cloudflare R2, named with the project ID and a version number (e.g., `project_id_v1.zip`).
  7.  Update the project status in D1 to `code_generated` and store the R2 object key. The process then hands off to the Testing Agent.

#### US-3.2: Odoo Development Guidelines Integration
**As a** developer, **I want to** ensure all generated code follows Odoo best practices **so that** modules are production-ready.
**Effort:** 13 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Prompt Engineering.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Create a file `core/prompts/odoo_guidelines.md` in your backend source.
  2.  Populate this file with key development rules from the official Odoo documentation (e.g., file structure, model naming, security rules, XML view structure).
  3.  When calling the coding agent (US-3.1), load the content of this file and include it as a core part of the system prompt, explicitly instructing the model to adhere to every rule listed.

#### US-3.3: Module File Tree Display
**As a** user, **I want to** see the structure of my generated module **so that** I can understand what files were created.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: React, JSZip, `@uiw/react-tree`.
- **Backend Steps**:
  1.  Create an endpoint `/projects/{id}/module-files`.
  2.  This endpoint gets the module zip from R2, reads its contents using Python's `zipfile` library, and returns a JSON array representing the file tree. **It must not return file content.**
- **Frontend Steps**:
  1.  On the project page, fetch the file tree JSON.
  2.  Use a component like `@uiw/react-tree` to render the data into an interactive tree view.
  3.  Add icons for folders and different file types (.py, .xml, .csv).

#### US-3.4: Code Generation Progress Tracking
**As a** user, **I want to** see the progress of my module generation **so that** I know the system is working.
**Effort:** 5 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: FastAPI (Server-Sent Events), React.
- **Steps**:
  1.  The long-running generation task (US-3.1) should periodically update the project's status in the D1 database (e.g., "generating_code", "zipping_files", "uploading").
  2.  Create an SSE endpoint `/projects/{id}/status`.
  3.  The frontend connects to this endpoint after starting generation.
  4.  The SSE endpoint continuously polls the database for the project's status and `yields` a message to the client whenever it changes.
  5.  The frontend displays the status messages to the user and closes the connection when a final state ("completed", "failed") is reached.

#### US-3.5: Module Versioning System
**As a** user, **I want to** track different versions of my module **so that** I can manage iterations and improvements.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Cloudflare D1, R2.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Create a new D1 table: `module_builds (id, project_id, version, r2_key, created_at)`.
  2.  Each time the coding agent runs successfully, it creates a new entry in this table.
  3.  The project page UI should include a dropdown or list to view past versions. Selecting a version can update the file tree view by calling the backend with a specific version ID.

---

## SPRINT 4 (Weeks 7-8): Testing Agent & Quality Assurance

#### US-4.1: Automated Testing & Quality Assurance Agent
**As a** user, **I want to** automatically test my generated module **so that** I can be confident it works correctly.
**Effort:** 34 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Docker, Docker Compose, Playwright, Pytest, FastAPI. Requires a separate, stateful "Test Runner" service running on a VM (e.g., on DigitalOcean/Hetzner), as Cloudflare Workers are stateless.
- **Agent Workflow**:
  1.  **Orchestration**: The main Cloudflare app triggers the Testing Agent via an API call to the Test Runner service. The request includes the project ID and a link to the module's ZIP file on R2.
  2.  **Environment Preparation**:
      *   The Test Runner service pulls a pre-configured Docker image for the required Odoo version (e.g., `omb/odoo:17.0`). These images are optimized with common dependencies, mimicking the clean environment of `runbot.odoo.com`.
      *   It dynamically creates a `docker-compose.yml` file, linking Odoo and a PostgreSQL database.
      *   It downloads the new module's ZIP from R2, extracts it, and mounts it into the Odoo container's `/mnt/extra-addons` directory.
  3.  **Container Startup & Module Installation**:
      *   The service executes `docker-compose up -d`.
      *   Once Odoo is running, the agent executes a command inside the container to install the new module: `odoo -d <db_name> -i <module_name> --stop-after-init`.
      *   It captures the logs from this command. If installation fails, the logs are captured as the primary error report, the environment is torn down, and the failure is reported back to the main app.
  4.  **Test Script Generation**:
      *   If installation succeeds, the agent calls a Claude 3 Sonnet model.
      *   **Prompt for Test Generation**: The prompt includes the module's source code and the original user specification. It instructs the AI: "Based on the provided module code and its specifications, generate a comprehensive Playwright test script (`tests/test_module.py`) using Pytest fixtures. The script must cover all acceptance criteria from the specification, including UI interactions, data validation, and business logic. Ensure tests are atomic and provide clear success/failure outputs."
  5.  **Test Execution**:
      *   The generated `test_module.py` is placed in a `tests` directory on the host.
      *   The agent runs the tests using `pytest tests/test_module.py`. The Playwright script connects to the running Odoo instance.
      *   Tests are executed in headless mode for maximum speed. Playwright automatically captures screenshots and traces on failure.
  6.  **Results & Reporting**:
      *   **Failure**: If any test fails, `pytest` exits with a non-zero code. The agent gathers the `pytest` output (traceback), failed test names, screenshots, and traces. This detailed report is sent to the main app's orchestration logic to trigger the bug-fixing loop (US-4.3). The Test Runner then tears down the environment (`docker-compose down -v`).
      *   **Success**: If all tests pass, the agent reports success. The project status is updated to `testing_passed`. The Test Runner service uploads a `results.json` and any logs to R2 and proceeds to prepare the UAT environment (see US-5.1).

#### US-4.2: Test Results Reporting
**As a** user, **I want to** see detailed test results for my module **so that** I can understand if it meets my requirements.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: React, FastAPI, R2.
- **Steps**:
  1.  After a test run (successful or failed), the Test Runner service uploads a `results.json` and any failure screenshots/traces to R2.
  2.  Create a `/projects/{id}/test-results` endpoint in the main CF app that retrieves and serves this data.
  3.  Frontend: Add a "Test Results" tab on the project page. It will display a summary (e.g., "5/6 tests passed"). List each test case with a pass/fail icon. For failures, show the error message from `results.json` and display the linked screenshot from R2. This view is updated after each cycle of the bug-fixing loop.

#### US-4.3: Automated Bug-Fixing Loop
**As a** system, **I want to** automatically fix detected issues **so that** modules can improve without manual intervention.
**Effort:** 13 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Orchestration logic in the main FastAPI app.
- **Steps**:
  1.  **Trigger**: Initiated by the main app's orchestration logic when the Testing Agent (US-4.1) reports test failures.
  2.  **Context Compilation**: The orchestrator gathers the test failure report, which includes the module's source code, the failing Playwright test script, the `pytest` error logs, and failure screenshots.
  3.  **Call to Coding Agent**: It calls the Coding Agent again with a specialized prompt for bug fixing.
  4.  **Bug-Fixing Prompt**: "You are an expert Odoo developer and debugger. The following Odoo module has a bug. I will provide the full module code, the test that failed, and the error message. Your task is to analyze the error, identify the root cause in the module's code, and fix it. Return the complete, corrected module code in the same JSON format as before."
  5.  **New Version Creation**: This creates a new module version (US-3.5) which is saved to R2.
  6.  **Re-Testing**: The orchestrator triggers the Testing Agent again, pointing it to the new module version. The entire testing process (US-4.1) restarts.
  7.  **Loop Termination**: A `fix_attempts` counter in the `projects` table limits the loop to 5 iterations. If it still fails, the project status is set to `failed_testing` and the user is notified.

#### US-4.4: Quick Testing Mode
**As a** developer, **I want to** enable quick testing with pre-generated data **so that** I can rapidly iterate.
**Effort:** 5 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: A simple boolean flag.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Add a `is_quick_test` boolean to the `projects` table in D1.
  2.  Add a toggle switch in the project settings UI.
  3.  When the testing agent is prompted to generate tests, if the flag is true, add to the prompt: "Generate only essential 'happy path' tests for the core functionality."

---

## SPRINT 5 (Weeks 9-10): User Acceptance Testing & Payment Flow

#### US-5.1: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Environment
**As a** user, **I want to** test my module in a live Odoo environment **so that** I can verify it works as expected before purchasing.
**Effort:** 13 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Docker, React, Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`).
- **Steps**:
  1.  **Trigger**: This flow begins after the Automated Testing (US-4.1) is successfully completed.
  2.  **Environment Persistence**: The Test Runner service keeps the Odoo and database containers from the successful test run active.
  3.  **Secure Tunneling**: It starts a `cloudflared` process to create a secure, temporary, and authenticated public tunnel to the running Odoo instance's web port. The tunnel URL is unique for the UAT session.
  4.  **Frontend Interface**:
      *   The main React app receives the secure tunnel URL and displays a dedicated UAT page.
      *   This page features a large, embedded `<iframe>` pointing to the Odoo instance. The interface will be designed to feel like an integrated browser, similar to platforms like Manus AI or OpenAI's Operator, giving the user direct, real-time access to their module.
      *   For security, the `<iframe>` will use the `sandbox` attribute to restrict popups and top-level navigation.
  5.  **Session Management**: A background job on the Test Runner service will automatically tear down the Docker environment and the Cloudflare Tunnel after a period of inactivity or a fixed duration (e.g., 60 minutes) to conserve resources. The user will be notified before the session expires.

#### US-5.2: User Adjustment Request System
**As a** user, **I want to** request up to 5 adjustments to my module **so that** it perfectly meets my needs.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: React, FastAPI.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Create a simple form next to the UAT iframe.
  2.  Submitting the form calls a `/projects/{id}/request-adjustment` endpoint.
  3.  The backend saves the request and triggers the bug-fixing loop (US-4.3), using the user's text as the "error report".
  4.  The agent's prompt will include the user's request and the original spec, with instructions to only implement the change if it doesn't contradict the spec (this is a hard AI problem, a simple implementation will just pass it on).

#### US-5.3: Dynamic Pricing System
**As a** platform owner, **I want to** automatically price modules based on complexity **so that** pricing is fair and profitable.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Heuristics in Python.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Create a service that analyzes the final generated module code.
  2.  Calculate a complexity score based on a weighted sum of: lines of code, number of Python models, number of XML views, and number of automated fix loops.
  3.  Map this score to a price between $50 and $100. For example: `price = 50 + (score / max_possible_score) * 50`.
  4.  Store the final price in the `projects` table.

#### US-5.4 & 5.5: Payment Processing & Module Download
**As a** user, **I want to** securely pay for my module **and** download it.
**Effort:** 13 + 8 = 21 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Stripe, React, FastAPI, R2.
- **Steps**:
  1.  After the user approves the UAT, the UI shows the final price and a "Pay to Download" button.
  2.  This button starts the Stripe payment flow (US-1.2) using the final price.
  3.  The Stripe webhook (US-1.2) is critical: upon successful payment, it updates the project's status in D1 to `paid`.
  4.  The UI polls for this status change. When it sees `paid`, the "Pay" button becomes a "Download" button.
  5.  The "Download" button calls a `/projects/{id}/download` endpoint.
  6.  This endpoint first verifies the `paid` status, then generates a short-lived, pre-signed download URL for the module zip in R2 and returns it.
  7.  The frontend receives the URL and programmatically starts the download.

## SPRINT 6 (Weeks 11-12): Production Deployment & Optimization

#### US-6.1: Production Monitoring System
**As a** platform owner, **I want to** monitor system health and performance **so that** I can ensure reliable service.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Cloudflare Analytics, Sentry.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Review the built-in analytics in the Cloudflare dashboard for Workers and Pages.
  2.  Integrate the Sentry SDK into both the FastAPI backend (`sentry-sdk[fastapi]`) and the React frontend (`@sentry/react`).
  3.  Initialize Sentry with your DSN, stored as a secret/environment variable. It will automatically capture errors.
  4.  Configure alerts in Sentry to get notified of new or high-frequency issues.

#### US-6.2: Security Hardening
**As a** platform owner, **I want to** ensure the platform is secure **so that** user data and payments are protected.
**Effort:** 13 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Cloudflare WAF, `pip-audit`, `npm audit`.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Enable the Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) and its Managed Rulesets (e.g., OWASP Core Ruleset) to block common attacks.
  2.  Routinely run `npm audit --production` and `pip-audit` in your CI/CD pipeline to find and fix vulnerable dependencies.
  3.  Ensure all Pydantic models in FastAPI have strict type and format validation.
  4.  Add rate limiting rules in the Cloudflare dashboard for sensitive endpoints like login and registration.

#### US-6.3: Performance Optimization
**As a** user, **I want to** experience fast response times **so that** the platform is pleasant to use.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: React DevTools, `vite-bundle-visualizer`.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to code-split your React application by routes. This means users only download the code for the page they are on.
  2.  Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components. Profile with React DevTools.
  3.  Use the `vite-bundle-visualizer` plugin to see what's taking up space in your production JavaScript bundle and look for opportunities to reduce it.
  4.  Ensure all large assets (images, etc.) are compressed.

#### US-6.4: Documentation & Help System
**As a** user, **I want to** access comprehensive documentation **so that** I can effectively use the platform.
**Effort:** 8 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: Markdown, React.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Create a `/docs` folder in your frontend source code containing simple markdown files (`guide.md`, `faq.md`).
  2.  Create a `/help` route in your React app.
  3.  This page can fetch the markdown files and render them using `react-markdown`.
  4.  Your API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI at the `/docs` endpoint of your API URL. Link to this from the help page.

#### US-6.5: Production Deployment Pipeline
**As a** developer, **I want to** deploy updates safely and efficiently **so that** the platform can evolve without downtime.
**Effort:** 13 points
**Implementation Details:**
- **Tech**: GitHub Actions.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.
  2.  Create two jobs in the workflow: `deploy-frontend` and `deploy-backend`.
  3.  `deploy-frontend`: Runs on push to `main`. It checks out code, runs `npm install`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, and then uses the official `cloudflare/pages-action` to deploy the `dist` folder to Cloudflare Pages.
  4.  `deploy-backend`: Runs on push to `main`. It sets up Python, installs dependencies, runs `pytest`, and then uses `wrangler publish` to deploy the worker.

#### US-6.6: Launch Preparation
**As a** platform owner, **I want to** prepare for public launch **so that** users can successfully use the platform.
**Effort:** 8 points
- **Implementation Details**:
- **Tech**: `k6` for load testing.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Write a simple load testing script in JavaScript using `k6`. It should simulate a user registering, creating a project, and generating a specification.
  2.  Run the test to see how many virtual users the system can handle.
  3.  Create a simple, attractive landing page for non-logged-in users.
  4.  Set up a support email address (e.g., `support@yourdomain.com`).
  5.  Manually run through the entire user journey one last time to catch any obvious bugs.
