# Odoo Module Builder Frontend Design Plan - Gemini

## 1. Vision & Concept

Create a highly engaging and visually stunning frontend for the Odoo Module Builder. The core concept revolves around a "Builder Portal" – an immersive, animated experience that guides users through the module creation process step-by-step, similar to Typeform. This is complemented by a clean, professional dashboard for managing existing modules. The goal is to make module creation intuitive, enjoyable, and visually memorable.

## 2. Design Philosophy

*   **Immersive First**: Utilize extraordinary animations (e.g., Magic-MCP, [21st.dev Waves](https://21st.dev/DavidHDev/waves-background/default)) to create a sense of entering a dedicated creation space.
*   **Guided Creation**: Employ a linear, focused, Typeform-style questionnaire for defining module specifics.
*   **Visual Feedback**: Animations should provide meaningful feedback, illustrating progress and structure.
*   **Clarity & Control**: Balance the dynamic visuals with clear navigation and a well-organized dashboard for module management.
*   **Modern Aesthetics**: A sleek, professional look that incorporates playful but sophisticated animations.

## 3. Key Features & UI Structure

### A. The Builder Portal (Module Creation Flow)

*   **Entry Animation**: A captivating animation (e.g., swirling particles, vortex effect, evolving waves) triggered when initiating new module creation, visually representing "entering the portal".
*   **Step-by-Step Questions**:
    *   One primary question or input group per view.
    *   Large, clear typography and focused layout.
    *   Smooth, animated transitions between steps (e.g., card flips, zooms, slides with perspective shifts).
    *   Interactive progress bar/indicator visualizing the journey through the portal.
    *   Animated input elements (e.g., fields that subtly glow or expand on focus).
*   **Question Categories**:
    *   Module Metadata (Name, Technical Name, Version, Author, Description, Category)
    *   Dependencies (Selection with animated suggestions)
    *   Model Definition (Fields, Relationships - potentially a simplified visual graph element)
    *   View Configuration (Form, Tree, Kanban - options appear dynamically)
    *   Security Rules (Group/Access selection)
    *   Basic Business Logic (Toggles or simple inputs for common patterns)
*   **Live Preview/Summary**: A persistent but minimal sidebar or element showing the evolving structure of the module as inputs are provided.
*   **Generation Animation**: A final animation sequence visualizing the "assembly" or "forging" of the module code upon completion.

### B. The Dashboard (Module Management)

*   **Layout**: Clean, grid or list-based view of previously created/managed modules.
*   **Module Cards**:
    *   Display key info (Name, Version, Status).
    *   Subtle hover animations (e.g., slight lift, background shimmer, action icons appearing).
    *   Quick actions (Download, Edit (re-enter portal), View Details).
*   **Hero Section**: Features the main "Enter Builder Portal" CTA, potentially incorporating the wave background from 21st.dev.
*   **Navigation**: Simple, possibly animated sidebar or header menu to switch between Dashboard and potentially other sections (Settings, Account).

## 4. Animation & Visual Style

*   **Core Animation Tech**: Framer Motion, GSAP, potentially Three.js for portal effects.
*   **Backgrounds**: Animated gradients, particle systems (like the 21st.dev waves), subtle geometric patterns that shift and evolve.
*   **Transitions**: Focus on seamlessness and visual interest – avoid jarring cuts. Use easing and potentially physics-based animations.
*   **Micro-interactions**: Animated feedback for button clicks, form submissions, loading states using techniques like Lottie or custom CSS/SVG animations.
*   **Color Palette**: Professional base (e.g., deep blues, grays, whites) accented with vibrant colors for interactive elements and portal animations.

## 5. Technical Stack (Suggestions)

*   **Framework**: React (Next.js) or Vue (Nuxt.js) for structure and routing.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, potentially CSS Modules for component-specific styles.
*   **Animation Libraries**: Framer Motion (React), Vue Transitions/GSAP (Vue), Three.js (for complex 3D), Magic-MCP (if suitable pre-built effects match).
*   **State Management**: Zustand (React), Pinia (Vue), or Context API/Composables.
*   **UI Components**: Headless UI or Radix UI for accessible primitives, custom-styled.

## 6. User Flow Example

1.  **Land on Dashboard**: See existing modules (if any) and the prominent "Create New Module / Enter Portal" button over an animated background.
2.  **Click Create**: Trigger the "Portal Entry" animation.
3.  **Enter Portal**: Transition to the first question screen (e.g., Module Name). Background/UI elements subtly shift to indicate being "inside" the portal.
4.  **Progress Through Steps**: Answer questions one by one, experiencing smooth transitions between each step. See the progress indicator advance.
5.  **Review**: Reach a summary screen showing all configured options.
6.  **Generate**: Click "Generate Module", triggering the "Generation" animation.
7.  **Exit Portal**: Animation sequence returns the user to the Dashboard, where the newly created module card animates into place.

## 7. Considerations

*   **Performance**: Optimize animations (hardware acceleration, `requestAnimationFrame`), lazy-load heavy assets, provide an option to reduce motion.
*   **Responsiveness**: Ensure animations and layouts adapt gracefully to various screen sizes. Simplify complex animations on mobile.
*   **Accessibility**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, ensure keyboard navigation, use ARIA attributes, maintain color contrast.
*   **Maintainability**: Structure animation logic cleanly within components or dedicated hooks/composables.

This plan aims for a frontend that is not just functional but memorable and delightful to use, transforming module creation from a chore into an engaging experience.
