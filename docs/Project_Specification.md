# Project Specification: Odoo Module Builder App

## 1. Project Goal

Develop a web-based application, similar in user experience to ChatGPT, that allows users to generate custom Odoo ERP modules. The application will guide users through a series of questions to define the module requirements, generate a detailed specification document for user review and approval, create a development plan, and then automatically generate, test, and deliver the Odoo module file.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. User Interaction & Input
-   **Guided Prompting:** The application must guide the user through a series of questions structured like a user story to gather module requirements effectively.
-   **Conversational Interface:** Provide a chat-like interface for users to interact with the application.
-   **Specification Review & Modification:** Present the generated module specification document to the user for review. Allow users to request modifications until the specification meets their satisfaction.
-   **Development Plan Review:** Display the step-by-step development plan before initiating module generation.

### 2.2. Module Generation
-   **Specification Generation:** Automatically create a detailed module specification document (as a text file within the module) based on user inputs.
-   **Development Plan Generation:** Generate a step-by-step plan for developing the module based on the confirmed specification.
-   **Code Generation:** Execute the development plan to generate the necessary code and file structure for the Odoo module.
-   **Output:** Provide the final, packaged Odoo module as a downloadable file.

### 2.3. Testing & Validation
-   **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests to check the generated module for errors.
-   **Frontend Browser Automation:** Utilize browser automation (e.g., Browser MCP or similar) to perform frontend testing, simulating human interaction with the Odoo instance running the module.
-   **Screenshot Generation:** Capture screenshots during frontend testing as part of the "Proof of Tests".
-   **Error Reporting:** Feed back errors and screenshot evidence to the underlying LLM for potential self-correction or reporting.
-   **Test Scenario Generation:** Automatically generate a `Test_scenarios.txt` file containing test cases covering processes impacted by the generated module. Aim for comprehensive coverage of potential use cases.
-   **Proof of Tests:** Create a `Proof_of_tests.md` (or similar) file documenting test results, including screenshots, to visually confirm correct frontend behavior according to the specification.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **Web Accessibility:** The application must be accessible via a standard web browser.
-   **Cloud Odoo Instance:** The system requires access to a running Odoo instance (likely cloud-hosted) for testing the generated modules.
-   **Scalability:** Consider potential future needs for handling multiple users or complex module generations.
-   **Security:** Ensure secure handling of user input and generated code.

## 4. Technical Specification (High-Level)

-   **Frontend:** Web application interface (Specific technologies TBD - e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
-   **Backend:** Server-side logic to handle user interaction, LLM communication, Odoo instance interaction, file generation (Specific technologies TBD - e.g., Python/Flask/Django, Node.js/Express).
-   **LLM Integration:** Interface with a suitable Large Language Model for specification generation, planning, and potentially code generation/correction.
-   **Odoo Instance:** A dedicated Odoo environment (version TBD) accessible by the application for testing.
-   **Testing Framework:** Browser automation tool (e.g., Playwright, Selenium, or Browser MCP if suitable) and potentially backend testing frameworks (e.g., pytest for Python).
-   **Deployment:** Cloud-based deployment platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).

## 5. Project Plan / Roadmap (Draft)

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Specification**
    *   Setup project structure, version control.
    *   Develop core chat interface and user input handling.
    *   Implement LLM integration for specification generation.
    *   Develop specification review and approval workflow.
    *   Setup basic Odoo testing instance.
2.  **Phase 2: Planning & Basic Generation**
    *   Implement development plan generation based on approved specs.
    *   Develop initial Odoo module structure generation logic.
    *   Implement basic code generation capabilities based on the plan.
3.  **Phase 3: Testing Integration**
    *   Integrate backend testing framework.
    *   Integrate browser automation framework for frontend testing.
    *   Implement screenshot capture and storage.
    *   Develop `Test_scenarios.txt` generation.
    *   Develop `Proof_of_tests.md` generation.
4.  **Phase 4: Refinement & Deployment**
    *   Refine LLM prompts for better accuracy and self-correction based on test feedback.
    *   Improve error handling and reporting.
    *   User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
    *   Prepare for deployment.
    *   Deploy to production environment.

## 6. Testing Strategy

-   **Unit Tests:** Test individual backend functions (e.g., input parsing, file generation logic).
-   **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between components (e.g., backend <-> LLM, backend <-> Odoo instance).
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Use browser automation to simulate the full user journey, from inputting requirements to receiving and testing a generated module in the Odoo frontend. Focus on validating visual correctness and functionality as described in `Objective.md` and the generated specification.
-   **Test Scenario Coverage:** Ensure generated `Test_scenarios.txt` aims for high coverage of use cases relevant to the specific module being built.

## 7. Budget

*   **Note:** Budget details need to be defined. This should include costs for:
    *   Development time (Frontend, Backend, LLM Integration, Testing).
    *   Cloud hosting (Application server, Database, Odoo instance).
    *   LLM API usage costs (if applicable).
    *   Third-party tool licenses (if any).

## 8. Assumptions & Risks

-   **Assumptions:**
    *   Availability of a suitable LLM API with required capabilities.
    *   Feasibility of reliably generating correct Odoo module code via LLM/automation.
    *   Accessibility and controllability of a cloud Odoo instance for testing.
    *   Browser automation can reliably interact with the Odoo frontend.
-   **Risks:**
    *   LLM limitations in understanding complex requirements or generating bug-free code.
    *   Complexity in accurately testing generated Odoo modules automatically.
    *   Changes in Odoo versions breaking compatibility or testing routines.
    *   Scalability challenges with LLM processing or Odoo instance load.
    *   Security vulnerabilities in generated code or the application itself.
