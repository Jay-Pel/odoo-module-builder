# Odoo Module Builder – Frontend Design Plan (O3 Edition)

## 1. Vision & Core Concept

Craft an unforgettable, animation‑driven experience for creating Odoo modules.  
The interface is conceived as a **"Quantum Portal"** – users step through an animated gateway and are then guided, Typeform‑style, through a series of focused questions.  
Parallel to this immersive flow sits a professional **Command Deck** (dashboard) where users manage previously generated modules.

*Goal*: Transform module building from a technical chore into an inspiring, almost game‑like journey while retaining clarity, accessibility, and performance.

## 2. Design Philosophy

1. **Portal First** – Every journey starts with an evocative animation (e.g., swirling particles → tunnel warp → calm creation space).  
2. **One‑Thought‑Per‑Screen** – Mimic Typeform: each question or logical group lives on its own, maximising focus.  
3. **Visual Feedback Everywhere** – Progress is visible through animated timelines, particle flux, or colour shifts.  
4. **Duality of Play & Professionalism** – Balance spectacular motion with a crisp, enterprise‑ready dashboard.  
5. **Performance & Accessibility** – GPU‑accelerated effects, `prefers‑reduced‑motion` support, colour‑safe palette.

## 3. Key UI Areas

### A. Quantum Portal (Creation Flow)

| Stage | Description | Animation Touches |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Entry Gate** | User clicks **"Enter Builder Portal"** | Magic‑MCP gate spins open, wave‑background intensifies, camera zooms inward |
| **Question Screens** | Sequential forms: Metadata → Dependencies → Models → Views → Security → Logic | Card flip or parallax slide. Framer‑Motion stagger, subtle glow on focused fields |
| **Live Blueprint Panel** | Side bar summarising answers in real‑time | Items animate in with mini‑spark bursts |
| **Forge Sequence** | On "Generate Module" | 3D assembly animation using Three.js – code fragments orbit → merge → success checkmark |
| **Exit Gate** | Return to dashboard | Reverse tunnel, calm settling effect |

### B. Command Deck (Dashboard)

* Grid/list of module **Cards** with key metadata.
* Hero area with animated **21st.dev waves** + large **"Launch Portal"** button.
* Quick actions: Download, Re‑enter Portal, Delete.
* Optional filters & search with micro‑interactions (e.g., input underline grows on focus).

## 4. Animation & Visual Style

* **Core Libraries**:  
  * **Magic‑MCP** for out‑of‑box portal motifs.  
  * **Framer Motion** for page/element transitions.  
  * **Three.js** for 3D tunnel & forging sequence.  
  * **21st.dev waves‑background** as ambient motion layer.  
* **Colour Palette**:  Deep space blues & charcoals, accented by vibrant tech‑neon (cyan, magenta, electric purple).
* **Typography**:  Clean sans‑serif (Inter / Poppins) with large question headlines.
* **Micro‑interactions**:  Button press waves, loading dots morphing into checkmarks.
* **Audio (Optional)**:  Subtle whoosh when entering/exiting portal (muted by default).

## 5. Technical Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---------|--------|
| **Framework** | Next.js (React 18, App Router) |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + `@tailwindcss/animate` |
| **State** | Zustand (portal answers), React‑Query (API) |
| **Animations** | Framer Motion, Magic‑MCP, GSAP (fallback strongly typed) |
| **3D** | Three.js / React‑Three‑Fiber |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form + Zod validaton |
| **Auth & Data** | Supabase or custom Django/Odoo backend API |

## 6. User Flow Walkthrough

1. **Dashboard Landing** – Wave background gently oscillates; modules cards fade‑in.  
2. **Launch Portal** – Click triggers `await animatePortalEntry()`.  
3. **Question 1: Module Name** – Big centred input. On submit, card slides up + next question slides in.  
4. **Mid‑Flow** – Live Blueprint panel builds up; progress ring fills.  
5. **Final Review** – Collapsible sections with edit buttons.  
6. **Forge** – Three.js animation plays, async API call returns zip.  
7. **Completion** – Success toast; module card materialises back on dashboard.

---

## 7. Accessibility & Performance

* Honour `prefers‑reduced‑motion`; swap out heavy animations for fades.  
* Lazy load Three.js scenes.  
* Use `motion.div` **viewport** props for off‑screen animation triggers.  
* Provide full keyboard navigation & screen‑reader labels.

## 8. Roadmap & Deliverables

1. **Prototype Portal Entry (Week 1)** – Simple Next.js page with Magic‑MCP gate & waves background.  
2. **Typeform Flow MVP (Week 2)** – Implement 5‑step questionnaire with Framer transitions & state.  
3. **Dashboard Skeleton (Week 3)** – Module list, hero section, routing.  
4. **Three.js Forge (Week 4)** – Prototype 3D assembly animation.  
5. **Polish & Accessibility (Week 5)** – Performance tweaks, reduced‑motion variant, audits.

> By combining cutting‑edge animation libraries with a disciplined, step‑by‑step UX, the Odoo Module Builder O3 frontend will feel like leaping into a futuristic workshop – empowering, delightful, and friction‑free.
