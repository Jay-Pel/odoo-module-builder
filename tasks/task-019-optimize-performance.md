# Task: Optimize Performance

## Description
Implement performance optimizations throughout the application to ensure fast load times and smooth interactions. This task focuses on code splitting, virtualization, and memoization to improve overall application performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Add code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Optimize component rendering
- Reduce bundle size
- Improve initial load time
- Ensure smooth animations and transitions

## Technical Details
- Implement React.lazy and Suspense for route-based code splitting
- Use React.memo for pure components
- Implement useMemo and useCallback hooks for performance
- Add virtualization with react-window for long lists
- Optimize React Context usage
- Implement performance monitoring
- Use Chrome DevTools and React Profiler for optimization
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders

## Subtasks
1. ⬜ Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
2. ⬜ Add Suspense fallbacks for async components
3. ⬜ Optimize list rendering with virtualization
4. ⬜ Use memoization for expensive calculations
5. ⬜ Review and optimize context providers
6. ⬜ Add performance monitoring
7. ⬜ Benchmark and document performance improvements
