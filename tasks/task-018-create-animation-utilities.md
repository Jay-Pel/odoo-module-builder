# Task: Create Animation Utility Functions

## Description
Develop a set of reusable animation utility functions to ensure consistent animations throughout the application. These utilities will improve the user experience by providing smooth and predictable motion patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create `src/utils/animations.js` with reusable animations
- Implement consistent entrance/exit animations
- Add loading state animations
- Create transition utilities for page changes
- Ensure animations respect user's reduced motion preferences
- Make animations configurable for different components

## Technical Details
- Use Framer Motion for animation implementation
- Create reusable animation variants
- Implement animation utilities that respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Add spring animations for natural movement
- Create staggered animation helpers for lists
- Implement loading state animations (pulse, skeleton, etc.)
- Add page transition animations
