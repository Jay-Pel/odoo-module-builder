# Task: Add Error Boundaries

## Description
Implement error boundaries throughout the application to gracefully handle runtime errors and prevent the entire UI from crashing. This will improve application resilience and provide a better user experience when errors occur.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create `src/components/Common/ErrorBoundary.jsx` component
- Add fallback UI for component errors
- Implement error reporting mechanism
- Create error boundaries at appropriate component levels
- Add helpful error messages for users
- Ensure proper logging for debugging
- Implement recovery options where possible

## Technical Details
- Use React's Error Boundary feature
- Create a reusable ErrorBoundary component
- Design user-friendly fallback UI
- Implement error reporting to console and optional service
- Add reset functionality for error states
- Consider different boundary scopes (page-level, feature-level)
- Use try/catch for handling async errors
