## Current Sprint Focus

### Immediate Priority (Next 24-48 hours)
1. Fix UI Interaction Issues (Task 026) - BLOCKER
   - Fix SpecificationStep "Edit Specification" and "Regenerate" buttons
   - Ensure proper data consistency between steps (version number preservation)
   - Fix Development Plan section expansion/collapse functionality
   - Make Module Output file browser functional with proper code display
   - Create closable test scenario control window

2. Module Session Management (Task 021) - BLOCKER
   - Required by completed Home Page
   - Required by in-progress Guided Workflow
   - Implement state management for module creation process
   - Add session persistence
   - Integrate with existing components

3. Complete Guided Workflow (Task 022)
   - Finish remaining wizard steps
   - Connect with session management
   - Implement state transitions
   - Fix interactive element functionality across all steps

4. Implement Docker Testing Environment (Task 025) - NEW
   - Set up Docker integration for Odoo testing
   - Create final step in wizard for module testing
   - Implement iframe for displaying running Odoo instance
   - Add testing controls and feedback mechanisms

### Secondary Focus (This Week)
1. Module Progress Dashboard (Task 023)
   - Design dashboard layout
   - Implement ModuleCard and Grid components (Tasks 010, 011)
   - Integrate with session management

2. User Experience Improvements
   - Complete GSAP Animations (Task 003)
   - Add Tooltips (Task 007)
   - Implement Markdown Viewer (Task 008)

## Upcoming Work (Next Sprint)
- Performance optimization (Task 019)
- ChatWidget for Global Assistance (Task 015)
- Profile and Resources pages (Tasks 012, 014)
- Test Controls System improvements (Task 027)

## Dependencies

Critical Path:
1. UI Interaction Fixes (026) ➡️ Session Management (021) ➡️ Guided Workflow (022) ➡️ Docker Testing (025) ➡️ Progress Dashboard (023)
2. Error Boundaries (020) must be implemented alongside Session Management
3. ModuleCard Components (010, 011) required for Dashboard (023)

## Notes

- Critical UI issues discovered during testing need immediate attention
- Several functional problems identified in the workflow:
  - Version specified in Requirements step not carried forward to Specification
  - SpecificationStep buttons (Edit/Regenerate) non-functional
  - Development Plan collapsible sections not working
  - Module Output file browser not properly displaying selected files
- Need to add a final step for testing modules in a Docker-based Odoo instance
- Test scenario control system needs improvements (ability to close, better test feedback)
- Session Management remains a high priority as it's blocking other completed and in-progress work
- Focus on fixing existing functionality before adding new features
