# Specification Formatting Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the specification display in the Odoo Module Builder to provide a much more readable and professional-looking format, similar to what you'd see in a normal document editor.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Typography and Styling
- **Added Tailwind CSS Typography plugin** (`@tailwindcss/typography`) for beautiful prose styling
- **Custom typography classes** with proper spacing, colors, and font weights
- **Better text hierarchy** with distinct heading styles and proper spacing

### 2. Content Formatting
- **Automatic text processing** to structure plain text into proper Markdown format
- **Numbered sections** are converted to proper headings with spacing
- **Technical terms** like `product.template` are automatically formatted as code
- **Better paragraph breaks** and spacing throughout the document

### 3. Enhanced Markdown Rendering
- **ReactMarkdown** with GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) support
- **remark-breaks** plugin for better line break handling
- **Syntax highlighting** with highlight.js using GitHub theme
- **Custom component renderers** for paragraphs, headings, lists, and code blocks

### 4. Visual Improvements
- **Clean, modern design** with proper spacing and typography
- **Code highlighting** with background colors and proper formatting
- **Structured headings** with underlines and consistent spacing
- **Readable color scheme** with proper contrast and hierarchy

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```bash
npm install @tailwindcss/typography remark-breaks highlight.js
```

### Key Components
- `SpecificationDisplay` - Custom component for enhanced formatting
- `formatSpecification` - Text preprocessing function for structure
- Custom ReactMarkdown renderers for each element type

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/SpecificationEditor.jsx` - Main specification display
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js` - Added typography plugin
- `frontend/src/main.jsx` - Added highlight.js CSS

## Result
The specification now displays with:
- ✅ **Proper headings** with clear hierarchy
- ✅ **Well-spaced content** that's easy to read
- ✅ **Highlighted code terms** for technical content
- ✅ **Professional typography** throughout
- ✅ **Structured layout** similar to documentation sites

This makes the generated specifications much more professional and easier to review before approval.
