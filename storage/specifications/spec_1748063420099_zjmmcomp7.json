  "markdown": "# Odoo Module Development Specification: Test Request Change Module\n\n**Document Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Author:** Odoo Module Builder App\n\n---\n\n## 1. Module Overview\n\n### 1.1. Purpose and Objectives\n\nThe \"Test Request Change Module\" (technical name: `test_request_change`) aims to provide a simple, yet effective task management solution within Odoo. Its primary objective is to enable users to efficiently create, track, and manage tasks, facilitating better organization and accountability within a team or individual workflow.\n\n**Key Objectives:**\n*   Streamline task creation and assignment.\n*   Provide clear visibility into task status and priorities.\n*   Automate notifications for task assignments and upcoming deadlines.\n*   Offer basic reporting on task completion to monitor progress.\n*   Ensure seamless integration and compatibility with Odoo 18.0 Community and Enterprise editions.\n\n### 1.2. Target Odoo Version and Edition Compatibility\n\nThis module will be developed for and fully compatible with:\n*   **Odoo Version:** 18.0\n*   **Odoo Editions:** Community Edition & Enterprise Edition\n\n### 1.3. Dependencies and Requirements\n\nThe module will have the following dependencies:\n*   `base`: Standard Odoo base module.\n*   `mail`: For email notifications and chatter functionality.\n*   `web`: For standard web client components.\n\nNo external Python libraries beyond what Odoo 18.0 natively provides are anticipated.\n\n## 2. Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1. Detailed Feature Descriptions\n\n#### 2.1.1. Task Model Definition\nA core `Task` model will be introduced, representing an individual task.\n*   **Task Name (Required):** A short, descriptive title for the task.\n*   **Description:** Detailed information or notes related to the task.\n*   **Priority:** Categorization of task importance (Low, Medium, High).\n*   **Status:** Current state of the task (New, In Progress, Completed).\n*   **Assigned User:** The Odoo user responsible for completing the task.\n*   **Due Date:** The target completion date for the task.\n\n#### 2.1.2. Views\nThe module will provide a user-friendly interface through standard Odoo views.\n*   **List View (Tree View):** Displays all tasks in a tabular format, allowing for quick scanning and sorting. Key fields visible: Task Name, Status, Priority, Assigned User, Due Date.\n*   **Form View:** A detailed view for creating new tasks and editing existing ones. All task fields will be present, along with the Odoo Chatter for communication and activity tracking.\n*   **Kanban View:** Visualizes tasks as cards organized by their 'Status'. Each card will display key information like Task Name, Priority, Assigned User, and Due Date, enabling easy drag-and-drop status updates.\n\n#### 2.1.3. Email Notifications\n*   **Task Assignment Notification:** An automated email notification will be sent to the assigned user whenever a task is assigned or reassigned to them. The email will include task details (name, description, due date, etc.) and a direct link to the task in Odoo.\n\n#### 2.1.4. Task Deadline Reminders\n*   **Automated Reminders:** A system will send automated email reminders for tasks nearing their due date. The frequency and threshold for these reminders (e.g., 1 day before due, on due date) will be configurable. Reminders will be sent to the assigned user.\n\n#### 2.1.5. Basic Reporting on Task Completion Rates\n*   **Completion Rate Overview:** A basic reporting feature will be available, likely through Odoo's built-in graph view, to visualize the distribution of tasks by status (New, In Progress, Completed). This will provide an overview of task completion rates over time or for specific periods.\n\n### 2.2. User Stories and Use Cases\n\n*   **US-001: Create and Assign a Task**\n    *   As a Project Manager, I want to create a new task, define its details (name, description, priority, due date), and assign it to a team member, so that work can be initiated and tracked.\n*   **US-002: Track Task Progress**\n    *   As a Task Owner, I want to easily update the status of my tasks (e.g., from 'New' to 'In Progress' or 'Completed'), so that my progress is reflected accurately.\n*   **US-003: View All Tasks**\n    *   As a Team Lead, I want to see a comprehensive list of all tasks, their current status, and who they are assigned to, so I can monitor overall team workload and progress.\n*   **US-004: Visual Task Management**\n    *   As a User, I want to view tasks in a Kanban board, grouped by status, so I can visually understand the workflow and easily move tasks between stages.\n*   **US-005: Receive Assignment Notifications**\n    *   As an Assigned User, I want to receive an email notification immediately when a task is assigned to me, including a link to the task, so I am promptly aware of my new responsibilities.\n*   **US-006: Receive Deadline Reminders**\n    *   As an Assigned User, I want to receive email reminders for tasks that are approaching or have passed their due date, so I can prioritize my work and avoid missed deadlines.\n*   **US-007: Analyze Task Completion**\n    *   As a Manager, I want to view a basic report or graph showing the completion rates of tasks, so I can assess productivity and identify bottlenecks.\n\n### 2.3. Business Logic Requirements\n\n*   **Task Name:** Must be a required field.\n*   **Status Transitions:** While the Kanban view allows drag-and-drop, the system should ideally support a natural flow: New -> In Progress -> Completed. Direct jumps (e.g., New to Completed) should be allowed for flexibility.\n*   **Email Notification Trigger:** Notifications for assignment must trigger only when the `assigned_user` field is set or changed.\n*   **Reminder Logic:** Deadline reminders should be triggered by a scheduled action (cron job) that checks tasks with a `due_date` within a configurable threshold and where the `status` is not 'Completed'.\n*   **Chatter:** The Task form view must include the Odoo Chatter component for internal communication, activity scheduling, and tracking changes to key fields (`status`, `assigned_user`).\n\n## 3. Technical Specifications\n\n### 3.1. Data Models and Relationships\n\n**Model Name:** `test_request_change.task`\n**Technical Name:** `test_request_change.task`\n\n| Field Name        | Odoo Type | String Label       | Required | Default Value   | Description / Notes                                     |\n| :---------------- | :-------- | :----------------- | :------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `name`            | `Char`    | Task Name          | True     |                 | The title of the task.                                  |\n| `description`     | `Text`    | Description        | False    |                 | Detailed description of the task.                       |\n| `priority`        | `Selection` | Priority           | False    | `'medium'`      | `[('low', 'Low'), ('medium', 'Medium'), ('high', 'High')]` |\n| `status`          | `Selection` | Status             | False    | `'new'`         | `[('new', 'New'), ('in_progress', 'In Progress'), ('completed', 'Completed')]` |\n| `user_id`         | `Many2one`| Assigned To        | False    |                 | Link to `res.users` model. Tracks changes for notifications. |\n| `date_deadline`   | `Date`    | Due Date           | False    |                 | The target completion date for the task.                |\n| `active`          | `Boolean` | Active             | False    | `True`          | Standard Odoo field for soft deletion.                  |\n\n**Inherited Fields (from `mail.thread`, `mail.activity.mixin`):**\nThe model will inherit from `mail.thread` and `mail.activity.mixin` to enable Chatter functionality (messages, log notes, activities) and `_track_subtype` for tracking changes to fields like `status` and `user_id`.\n\n### 3.2. Views and User Interface Requirements\n\nAll views will be defined in XML files within the `views/` directory.\n\n*   **Menu Item:** A top-level menu item \"Tasks\" under a new \"Test Request Change\" parent menu.\n    *   `ir.ui.menu` entry for \"Test Request Change\".\n    *   `ir.ui.menu` entry for \"Tasks\" under \"Test Request Change\".\n*   **Action Window:** An `ir.actions.act_window` will define the action for the `test_request_change.task` model, linking to its views.\n*   **Tree View (`test_request_change.task_tree_view`):**\n    *   `model`: `test_request_change.task`\n    *   Fields displayed: `name`, `status`, `priority`, `user_id`, `date_deadline`.\n    *   Default order: `status, priority desc, date_deadline`.\n*   **Form View (`test_request_change.task_form_view`):**\n    *   `model`: `test_request_change.task`\n    *   Layout: Use `group` and `sheet` for organized field placement.\n    *   Fields displayed: `name`, `description`, `priority`, `status`, `user_id`, `date_deadline`.\n    *   Include `<header>` for status buttons if workflow transitions are complex (not initially required but good practice).\n    *   Include `<div class=\"oe_chatter\">` for the Odoo Chatter.\n*   **Kanban View (`test_request_change.task_kanban_view`):**\n    *   `model`: `test_request_change.task`\n    *   Group by: `status`.\n    *   Card content: `name`, `priority`, `user_id`, `date_deadline`.\n    *   Color coding for priority (e.g., red for High, yellow for Medium, green for Low).\n    *   Drag-and-drop functionality for status updates.\n*   **Search View (`test_request_change.task_search_view`):**\n    *   `model`: `test_request_change.task`\n    *   Search fields: `name`, `description`, `user_id`.\n    *   Filters: By `status` (New, In Progress, Completed), By `user_id` (My Tasks).\n    *   Group by: `status`, `user_id`, `priority`.\n\n### 3.3. Workflow and Process Definitions\n\n*   **Task Creation:** Initiated via the \"Create\" button in any task view.\n*   **Task Update:** Any field can be updated via the Form view. Status can also be updated via Kanban drag-and-drop.\n*   **Assignment Notification Workflow:**\n    1.  User modifies or sets the `user_id` field on a `test_request_change.task` record.\n    2.  An `onchange` or `write` method override (or `_track_subtype` if tracking is sufficient) detects the change.\n    3.  A `mail.template` (e.g., `test_request_change.email_template_task_assignment`) is rendered with task details.\n    4.  An email is sent to the `user_id.partner_id.email`.\n*   **Deadline Reminder Workflow:**\n    1.  A `cron` job (`ir.cron`) is scheduled to run daily (or configurable frequency).\n    2.  The cron job's Python method queries `test_request_change.task` records where `status` is not 'Completed' and `date_deadline` is within a configurable threshold (e.g., today or tomorrow).\n    3.  For each eligible task, a `mail.template` (e.g., `test_request_change.email_template_task_deadline_reminder`) is rendered.\n    4.  An email is sent to the `user_id.partner_id.email`.\n\n### 3.4. API Endpoints (if applicable)\n\nNo external API endpoints are required for this module. All interactions will be handled internally within Odoo's ORM and standard web client.\nInternal \"API\" refers to:\n*   Python methods on the `test_request_change.task` model for business logic (e.g., `action_send_assignment_email`, `_cron_send_deadline_reminders`).\n*   Odoo's ORM methods (e.g., `create`, `write`, `search`).\n\n## 4. Security and Access Control\n\n### 4.1. User Groups and Permissions\n\nTwo primary user groups will be defined:\n\n*   **Task User (`test_request_change.group_task_user`):**\n    *   Can create new tasks.\n    *   Can read all tasks.\n    *   Can update their own tasks (where `user_id` is the current user).\n    *   Cannot delete tasks.\n*   **Task Manager (`test_request_change.group_task_manager`):**\n    *   Inherits permissions from `test_request_change.group_task_user`.\n    *   Can create, read, update, and delete all tasks.\n    *   Can access reporting features.\n\nThese groups will be visible under `Settings -> Users & Companies -> Groups`.\n\n### 4.2. Security Rules and Access Rights\n\nAccess rights will be managed via `ir.model.access.csv` and `ir.rule` records.\n\n*   **`ir.model.access.csv`:**\n    *   `test_request_change.group_task_user`: `read=1, write=1, create=1, unlink=0` for `test_request_change.task` model.\n    *   `test_request_change.group_task_manager`: `read=1, write=1, create=1, unlink=1` for `test_request_change.task` model.\n*   **`ir.rule` (Record Rules):**\n    *   **Rule Name:** `test_request_change.task_user_own_tasks_rule`\n        *   **Model:** `test_request_change.task`\n        *   **Groups:** `test_request_change.group_task_user`\n        *   **Domain:** `[('user_id', '=', user.id), ('user_id', '!=', False)]` for write/update operations.\n        *   **Permissions:** `read=1, write=1, create=1, unlink=0` (This rule will be combined with the `ir.model.access.csv` entry; the most restrictive permission applies for unlink).\n    *   **Rule Name:** `test_request_change.task_manager_all_tasks_rule`\n        *   **Model:** `test_request_change.task`\n        *   **Groups:** `test_request_change.group_task_manager`\n        *   **Domain:** `[(1, '=', 1)]` (Allows access to all records).\n        *   **Permissions:** `read=1, write=1, create=1, unlink=1`\n\n### 4.3. Data Privacy Considerations\n\n*   **Confidentiality:** Task data (name, description, assigned user) should only be accessible to authorized users based on the defined security groups and record rules.\n*   **Access Logging:** Odoo's standard auditing mechanisms (via `mail.thread` and activity logs) will track who created, modified, or commented on tasks.\n*   **Data Minimization:** Only necessary task information will be stored.\n\n## 5. Configuration and Settings\n\n### 5.1. Module Configuration Options\n\nA dedicated configuration section for the \"Test Request Change Module\" will be accessible via `Settings -> General Settings -> Test Request Change`. This will leverage `res.config.settings`.\n\n*   **Reminder Threshold:** A field to set the number of days before a due date that a reminder should be sent (e.g., '1' for one day before).\n*   **Default Priority:** A selection field to set the default priority for newly created tasks.\n\n### 5.2. System Parameters\n\nNo specific `ir.config_parameter` records are anticipated beyond those managed directly via `res.config.settings`.\n\n### 5.3. Installation and Setup Requirements\n\n*   **Module Installation:** The module will be installed like any other Odoo module:\n    1.  Place the `test_request_change` module folder in Odoo's `addons` path.\n    2.  Restart the Odoo service.\n    3.  Log in as an administrator.\n    4.  Navigate to `Apps`, update the apps list, and search for \"Test Request Change Module\".\n    5.  Click \"Install\".\n*   **Post-Installation:**\n    *   Verify the \"Test Request Change\" menu appears.\n    *   Assign \"Task User\" or \"Task Manager\" groups to relevant users.\n    *   Configure reminder thresholds and default priority in `Settings -> General Settings -> Test Request Change`.\n\n## 6. Testing Strategy\n\nA comprehensive testing strategy will be employed to ensure the module's quality, reliability, and adherence to requirements.\n\n### 6.1. Unit Testing Scenarios\n\nUnit tests will focus on individual Python methods and data model logic.\n\n*   **Task Model:**\n    *   Verify `create` method correctly sets default values (priority, status).\n    *   Test `write` method for field updates and constraint checks (e.g., required `name`).\n    *   Verify `name` field is correctly marked as required.\n*   **Email Notifications:**\n    *   Test `_send_assignment_email` method (or similar) is called when `user_id` changes.\n    *   Verify the correct `mail.template` is used.\n    *   Verify email content is generated correctly with task details.\n*   **Deadline Reminders:**\n    *   Test the cron job's Python method (`_cron_send_deadline_reminders`) correctly identifies tasks nearing their due date.\n    *   Verify emails are sent only for non-completed tasks.\n    *   Test configurable reminder threshold logic.\n\n### 6.2. Integration Testing Requirements\n\nIntegration tests will verify interactions between different components (models, views, automated actions).\n\n*   **Task Lifecycle:**\n    *   Create a task via Form view, verify its presence in List/Kanban views.\n    *   Update task status via Kanban drag-and-drop, verify update in Form/List views.\n    *   Assign a user to a task, verify assignment email is sent.\n    *   Set a due date for a task, verify reminder email is sent by cron job (simulating cron execution).\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Test a \"Task User\" can create tasks and modify their own, but not delete any task or modify tasks assigned to others.\n    *   Test a \"Task Manager\" can create, read, update, and delete any task.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   Create tasks with different statuses, verify the graph view accurately reflects the distribution.\n\n### 6.3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Criteria\n\nUAT will involve end-users validating the module against business requirements.\n\n*   **Task Management:**\n    *   Users can easily create, edit, and view tasks.\n    *   All task fields are present and function as expected.\n    *   Tasks are correctly displayed in List, Form, and Kanban views.\n    *   Kanban view allows intuitive status updates via drag-and-drop.\n*   **Notifications:**\n    *   Assigned users receive timely and accurate email notifications upon task assignment.\n    *   Assigned users receive timely and accurate email reminders for tasks nearing their due date.\n    *   Email content is clear and includes relevant task information and a direct link.\n*   **Reporting:**\n    *   The basic reporting (graph view) provides a clear overview of task completion rates.\n*   **Permissions:**\n    *   Users can only perform actions allowed by their assigned security group.\n    *   Managers have full control over all tasks.\n\n### 6.4. Performance Testing Considerations\n\n*   **Data Volume:** Test performance with a large number of tasks (e.g., 10,000+ tasks) to ensure views (especially List and Kanban) remain responsive.\n*   **Cron Job Efficiency:** Ensure the deadline reminder cron job runs efficiently and doesn't cause performance bottlenecks, especially with a large number of tasks. Queries should be optimized.\n*   **Concurrent Users:** Consider testing with multiple concurrent users creating and updating tasks to identify any locking or contention issues.\n\n## 7. Deployment and Maintenance\n\n### 7.1. Installation Instructions\n\nRefer to section 5.3. Installation is standard for an Odoo module. No special pre-installation steps are required beyond Odoo's usual setup.\n\n### 7.2. Update and Migration Procedures\n\n*   **Standard Odoo Updates:** The module will follow Odoo's standard update mechanisms. Minor version updates (e.g., 18.0.1 to 18.0.2) typically only require an Odoo service restart and module upgrade from the Apps menu.\n*   **Data Migration (Future Versions):** For major Odoo version upgrades (e.g., Odoo 18.0 to 19.0), or if significant data model changes occur within the module:\n    *   `n_migration` scripts will be provided in the `migrations/` directory to handle schema changes and data transformations.\n    *   Backward compatibility will be maintained where feasible, or clear migration paths will be documented.\n*   **Module Upgrade:** When upgrading the module, ensure all custom views, security rules, and automated actions are correctly reloaded and applied. Use `odoo -u test_request_change` or the upgrade button in the Odoo Apps menu.\n\n### 7.3. Backup and Recovery Considerations\n\n*   **Database Backup:** The module's data resides within the Odoo database. Standard Odoo database backup procedures (e.g., PostgreSQL backups) will cover the module's data.\n*   **Module Code Backup:** The module's code (`test_request_change` folder) should be included in the overall Odoo application code backup strategy (e.g., Git repository, file system backups).\n*   **Recovery:** In case of data loss or system failure, restoring the Odoo database and module code from a recent backup will restore the module's functionality and data.\n\n---",
