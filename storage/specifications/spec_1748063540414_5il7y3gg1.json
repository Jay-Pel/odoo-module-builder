Business Logic Requirements\n\n*   **Product Name:** Must be a required field.\n*   **SKU Code:** Must be unique (optional, but good practice for inventory). For this simple module, uniqueness is not enforced but recommended during data entry.\n*   **Stock Quantity:** Must be a non-negative numerical value (>= 0). Default to 0.\n*   **Unit Price:** Must be a non-negative numerical value (>= 0). Default to 0.\n*   **Category:** Products can be assigned to a category. If no category is selected, it can be left blank.\n*   **Supplier:** Products can be linked to an existing supplier (from Odoo's `res.partner` model). This field is optional.\n*   **Minimum Stock Level:** Must be a non-negative numerical value (>= 0). Default to 0.\n*   **Barcode:** Must be a unique character string if provided. This field is optional.\n*   **Last Updated:** This field will be automatically managed by Odoo (using `write_date`) and cannot be manually edited by users.\n*   **Low Stock Definition:** A product is considered \"low stock\" if its `stock_quantity` is less than or equal to its `min_stock_level`.\n*   **Most Expensive Definition:** \"Most expensive\" refers to products with the highest `unit_price`, limited to the top 5.\n\n## 3.

API Endpoints\n*   Standard Odoo ORM (Object Relational Mapper) will be used for all data interactions. This inherently exposes Odoo's RPC (XML-RPC/JSON-RPC) API for CRUD operations on the `request_change_test_module.product` and `request_change_test_module.product.category` models, allowing external systems to interact if needed. No custom API endpoints are required for this module.\n\n## 4. Security and Access Control\n\n### 4.1. User Groups and Permissions\nTwo new user groups will be created to manage access to the module's features:\n\n*   **Inventory Tracking / User:**\n    *   **Technical Name:** `request_change_test_module.group_inventory_user`\n    *   **Permissions:**\n        *   Read access to `request_change_test_module.product` records.\n        *   Read access to `request_change_test_module.product.category` records.\n        *   Read access to `res.partner` records (for supplier selection/viewing).\n        *   Write access to `stock_quantity` field on `request_change_test_module.product` (to allow stock updates).\n        *   No access to reports.\n*   **Inventory Tracking / Manager:**\n    *   **Technical Name:** `request_change_test_module.group_inventory_manager`\n    *   **Inherits:** `request_change_test_module.group_inventory_user`\n    *   **Permissions:**\n        *   Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to `request_change_test_module.product` records.\n        *   Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to `request_change_test_module.product.category` records.\n        *   Read access to `res.partner` records (for supplier selection/viewing).\n        *   **Read access to all reports (`action_inventory_overview`, `action_low_stock_products`, `action_most_expensive_products`).**\n\n### 4.2. Security Rules and Access Rights\nAccess rights will be defined in `ir.model.access.csv`.\n\n*   **`request_change_test_module.product`:**\n    *   `group_inventory_user`: Read (r), Write (w) for `stock_quantity` field only.\n    *   `group_inventory_manager`: Create (c), Read (r), Write (w), Delete (d).\n*   **`request_change_test_module.product.category`:**\n    *   `group_inventory_user`: Read (r).\n    *   `group_inventory_manager`: Create (c), Read (r), Write (w), Delete (d).\n*   **`res.partner`:**\n    *   `group_inventory_user`: Read (r).\n    *   `group_inventory_manager`: Read (r). (Note: If `res.partner` creation/management is needed for suppliers, this would typically fall under the `base.group_partner_manager` or a custom group for partners, not necessarily this module's manager group, unless explicitly required for *only* supplier partners).\n*   **Reports (Menu Items and Actions):**\n    *   `group_inventory_user`: No access.\n    *   `group_inventory_manager`: Read access to all report actions and menu items.\n\n### 4.3. Data Privacy Considerations\n*   All data will be stored within the Odoo database, subject to Odoo's inherent security features.\n*   Access to product, category, and linked supplier data will be strictly controlled by the defined access groups.\n*   No highly sensitive personal data is expected to be managed by this module beyond standard contact information for suppliers. Standard Odoo data protection practices apply.\n\n## 5. Configuration and Settings\n\n### 5.1. Module Configuration Options\n*   This module is designed to be simple and self-contained. No specific global configuration options are required for this initial version. All settings are managed directly through the product and category forms.\n\n### 5.2. System Parameters\n*   No custom system parameters are required for this module.\n\n### 5.3. Installation and Setup Requirements\n*   **Installation:**\n    1.  Place the `request_change_test_module` directory within Odoo's `addons` path.\n    2.  Restart the Odoo server.\n    3.  Log in to Odoo as an administrator.\n    4.  Navigate to \"Apps\" (or \"Applications\").\n    5.  Update the Apps list (if necessary, by clicking \"Update Apps List\").\n    6.  Search for \"Request Change Test Module\".\n    7.  Click \"Install\" for the module.\n*   **Post-Installation:**\n    *   Users will need to be assigned to the `Inventory Tracking / User` or `Inventory Tracking / Manager` security groups to access the module's features.\n\n## 6. Testing Strategy\n\n### 6.1. Unit Testing Scenarios\nUnit tests will be developed using Odoo's Python testing framework (`odoo.tests.common`).\n\n*   **Product Model Validation:**\n    *   Test `create` product with valid data (name, SKU, category, stock, price, supplier, min stock, barcode).\n    *   Test `create` product without `name` (should raise `ValidationError`).\n    *   Test `create` product with negative `stock_quantity` (should raise `ValidationError`).\n    *   Test `create` product with negative `unit_price` (should raise `ValidationError`).\n    *   Test `create` product with negative `min_stock_level` (should raise `ValidationError`).\n    *   Test `create` product with a duplicate `barcode` (should raise `IntegrityError` from `_sql_constraints`).\n    *   Test `write` to update `stock_quantity` to a negative value (should raise `ValidationError`).\n    *   Test `write` to update `unit_price` to a negative value (should raise `ValidationError`).\n    *   Test `write` to update `min_stock_level` to a negative value (should raise `ValidationError`).\n    *   Test `write` to update `barcode` to a duplicate value (should raise `IntegrityError`).\n    *   Test search and read operations, including by `barcode`.\n    *   Verify `write_date` automatically updates upon `write` operations.\n*   **Category Model Validation:**\n    *   Test `create` category with valid name.\n    *   Test `create` category without `name` (should raise `ValidationError`).\n*   **Reporting Logic:**\n    *   Test `search` with `domain=[('stock_quantity', '<=', 'min_stock_level')]` to ensure correct low stock products are returned.\n    *   Test `search` with `order='unit_price desc', limit=5` to ensure correct most expensive products are returned.\n    *   Test counting all products.\n\n### 6.2. Integration Testing Requirements\n*   Verify that the module installs correctly without conflicts with the `base` module.\n*   Confirm that the \"Inventory Tracking\" main menu and its sub-menus (\"Products\", \"Product Categories\", **\"Reports\" with its sub-menus**) appear correctly in the Odoo interface.\n*   Validate that product categories can be created and linked to products.\n*   Validate that suppliers (from `res.partner`) can be linked to products.\n*   Ensure that security groups (`group_inventory_user`, `group_inventory_manager`) are created and apply the correct access rights as defined.\n*   Test that users with `group_inventory_user` can read products and update stock, but not create/delete products or categories, nor access reports.\n*   Test that users with `group_inventory_manager` have full CRUD access and can access all reports.\n*   Verify that searching by `barcode` works as expected in the product tree view.\n*   **Verify that \"Inventory Overview\" displays the correct total product count.**\n*   **Verify that \"Low Stock Products\" report accurately filters products where `stock_quantity <= min_stock_level`.**\n*   **Verify that \"Most Expensive Products\" report accurately lists the top 5 products by unit price.**\n\n### 6.3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Criteria\nUAT will involve end-users validating the module's functionality against the user stories.\n\n*   **Product Creation:** User can successfully create a new product, providing all required and optional details, including supplier, minimum stock level, and barcode, and observe it in the product list.\n*   **Product Listing:** User can view the product list, verify all expected columns (including Supplier, Minimum Stock Level, Last Updated) are present and data is accurate. User can search and filter the list, including by barcode.\n*   **Product Detail View:** User can open a product's form view and see all details correctly displayed, including the `Last Updated` timestamp.\n*   **Stock Update:** User can manually modify the `Stock Quantity` of a product and verify the change is saved and reflected. User cannot enter negative stock.\n*   **Minimum Stock Level:** User can successfully set and view the `Minimum Stock Level` for a product, ensuring non-negative values are enforced.\n*   **Barcode Functionality:** User can successfully search for a product using its barcode in the product list view.\n*   **Access Control Validation:**\n    *   An `Inventory User` can view products, update stock, and search by barcode, but cannot create new products or categories, nor modify supplier, min stock, or barcode fields, nor access any reports.\n    *   An `Inventory Manager` can perform all operations (create, read, update, delete) on products and categories, including managing supplier, minimum stock, and barcode fields, and can access all reports.\n*   **Reporting Validation:**\n    *   User can successfully access the \"Inventory Overview\" report and confirm the total product count is accurate.\n    *   User can successfully access the \"Low Stock Products\" report and confirm it lists only products with `stock_quantity <= min_stock_level`.\n    *   User can successfully access the \"Most Expensive Products\" report and confirm it lists the top 5 products by `unit_price` in descending order.\n*   **Usability:** The interface is intuitive, easy to navigate, and consistent with Odoo's standard UI/UX.\n\n### 6.4. Performance Testing Considerations\n*   For this simple module with expected low data volume, extensive performance testing is not a primary focus.\n*   However, basic performance checks will be conducted to ensure:\n    *   Product list loads within acceptable timeframes (e.g., < 2-3 seconds for 1000 records).\n    *   Product form view opens and saves quickly.\n    *   **Report views load within acceptable timeframes.**\n*   Should the module scale to tens of thousands of products or more, further performance profiling and optimization (e.g., indexing, specific ORM queries) would be considered in future iterations.\n\n## 7. Deployment and Maintenance\n\n### 7.1. Installation Instructions\n*   **Development Environment:**\n    1.  Ensure Odoo 18.0 is running.\n```",
