Module Overview\n\n### 1.1 Purpose and Objectives\n\nThe primary purpose of the \"Module Generation Test\" Odoo module is to provide a simple, standalone product catalog management system within Odoo. It aims to offer basic functionalities for creating, viewing, searching, and managing product information, including product categories.\n\n**Objectives:**\n*   Enable users to maintain a centralized list of products with essential details.\n*   Facilitate efficient searching and filtering of products based on various criteria.\n*   Provide a dedicated interface for managing product categories.\n*   Ensure full compatibility and seamless integration with Odoo Community and Enterprise Edition 18.0.\n\n### 1.2 Target Odoo Version and Edition Compatibility\n\n*   **Target Odoo Version:** 18.0\n*   **Edition Compatibility:** Fully compatible with both Odoo Community Edition 18.0 and Odoo Enterprise Edition 18.0. The module will be developed using Odoo's standard API and best practices to ensure cross-edition compatibility.\n\n### 1.3 Dependencies and Requirements\n\n*   **Odoo Base Module:** The module will depend on Odoo's core `base` module.\n*   **No External Dependencies:** No external libraries or third-party modules are required beyond the standard Odoo framework.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Detailed Feature Descriptions\n\nThe module will provide the following core functionalities:\n\n1.  **Product Management:**\n    *   **Product Creation:** Users can create new product records with required (Product Name) and optional fields (Product Code/SKU, Category, Price, Description).\n    *   **Product Viewing:** Users can view a list of all products and detailed information for individual products via a form view.\n    *   **Product Editing:** Users can modify existing product details through the form view.\n    *   **Product Deletion:** Users can remove product records from the system.\n    *   **Product Search:** Users can search products by Product Name or Product Code/SKU.\n    *   **Product Filtering:** Users can filter products by Category.\n\n2.  **Product Category Management:**\n    *   **Category Creation:** Users can create new product categories by providing a Category Name.\n    *   **Category Viewing:** Users can view a list of all defined categories.\n    *   **Category Editing:** Users can modify existing category names.\n    *   **Category Deletion:** Users can remove category records. If a category is linked to products, the product's category field will be cleared (set to null) upon category deletion.\n\n### 2.2 User Stories and Use Cases\n\n*   **US-001: Create New Product**\n    *   **As a** Product Manager,\n    *   **I want to** create a new product record,\n    *   **So that I can** add it to the product catalog.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   User can access the product creation form from the \"Products\" menu.\n        *   User can enter Product Name (required), Product Code/SKU, select an existing Category, enter Price, and Description.\n        *   Upon saving, the product is successfully created and displayed in the product list and form view.\n        *   Attempting to save without a Product Name results in a validation error.\n\n*   **US-002: View Product List**\n    *   **As a** Sales Representative,\n    *   **I want to** view a list of all available products,\n    *   **So that I can** quickly browse the catalog.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   User can access the product list view from the \"Product Catalog\" menu.\n        *   The list displays Product Name, Product Code/SKU, Category, and Price in columns.\n        *   The list is sortable by these columns.\n\n*   **US-003: Search and Filter Products**\n    *   **As a** Product Manager,\n    *   **I want to** search for products by name or code and filter by category,\n    *   **So that I can** quickly find specific products.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   User can use the search bar to find products by partial Product Name or Product Code/SKU.\n        *   User can select an existing category from a filter dropdown to narrow down the product list.\n        *   Search and filter results are displayed accurately and dynamically.\n\n*   **US-004: Edit Existing Product**\n    *   **As a** Product Manager,\n    *   **I want to** modify details of an existing product,\n    *   **So that I can** keep the product information up-to-date.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   User can open an existing product's form view from the list.\n        *   User can update any editable field (Product Name, Product Code/SKU, Category, Price, Description).\n        *   Upon saving, changes are reflected in the product record and the list view.\n\n*   **US-005: Manage Product Categories**\n    *   **As a** Product Manager,\n    *   **I want to** create, view, edit, and delete product categories,\n    *   **So that I can** organize products effectively.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**\n        *   User can access a dedicated interface for category management from the \"Product Catalog\" menu.\n        *   User can create new categories by providing a unique name.\n        *   User can edit existing category names.\n        *   User can delete categories; if products are linked, their `category_id` field will be set to empty.\n\n### 2.3 Business Logic Requirements\n\n*   **Product Name:** Must be a required field.\n*   **Product Code/SKU:** Should ideally be unique, though not strictly enforced by a database constraint for initial flexibility.\n*   **Category Linkage:** A product can be assigned to one category. If a category is deleted, products previously linked to it will have their `category_id` field automatically set to `null` (empty).\n*   **Category Name:** Must be unique to prevent duplicate category entries.\n*   **Price:** Must be a numerical value (float).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Technical Specifications\n\n### 3.1 Data Models and Relationships\n\nThe module will define two new Odoo models: `product.catalog.product` and `product.catalog.category`.\n\n#### 3.1.1 Model: `product.catalog.product`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Stores individual product details.\n*   **Odoo Name:** `product.catalog.product`\n*   **Fields:**\n    *   `name` (Char): Product Name.\n        *   `string`: \"Product Name\"\n        *   `required`: True\n        *   `index`: True\n    *   `code` (Char): Product Code/SKU.\n        *   `string`: \"Product Code/SKU\"\n        *   `index`: True\n        *   `copy`: False (SKU should typically not be copied when duplicating a record)\n    *   `category_id` (Many2one): Link to the product category.\n        *   `string`: \"Category\"\n        *   `comodel_name`: 'product.catalog.category'\n        *   `ondelete`: 'set null' (When category is deleted, products linked to it will have their category field cleared)\n    *   `price` (Float): Product Price.\n        *   `string`: \"Price\"\n    *   `description` (Text): Detailed product description.\n        *   `string`: \"Description\"\n\n#### 3.1.2 Model: `product.catalog.category`\n\n*   **Purpose:** Stores product categories.\n*   **Odoo Name:** `product.catalog.category`\n*   **Fields:**\n    *   `name` (Char): Category Name.\n        *   `string`: \"Category Name\"\n        *   `required`: True\n        *   `index`: True\n        *   `unique`: True (ensures no two categories have the same name)\n    *   `product_ids` (One2many): Inverse relationship",
