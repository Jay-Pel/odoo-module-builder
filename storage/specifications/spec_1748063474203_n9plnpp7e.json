Module Overview\n\n### 1.1 Purpose and Objectives\n\nThe primary purpose of the `test_module` is to serve as a basic, yet comprehensive, example for Odoo module development. It aims to demonstrate adherence to Odoo best practices, including data model definition, UI/UX design, security implementation, and workflow management within the Odoo framework. While simple in functionality, it covers all essential aspects required for a production-ready Odoo module, making it an ideal template or a starting point for more complex developments.\n\n**Objectives:**\n*   To create a functional Odoo module that manages simple \"Test Records.\"\n*   To demonstrate core Odoo features such as model creation, views (form, tree, search), and menu integration.\n*   To implement a basic workflow with status transitions.\n*   To define granular access control using Odoo's security mechanisms.\n*   To provide a clear development specification for future reference and expansion.\n*   To ensure compatibility with Odoo Community and Enterprise editions.\n\n### 1.2 Target Odoo Version and Edition Compatibility\n\n*   **Odoo Version:** 18.0\n*   **Odoo Edition Compatibility:**\n    *   Odoo Community Edition 18.0\n    *   Odoo Enterprise Edition 18.0 (functionality relies solely on Community features, ensuring compatibility)\n\n### 1.3 Dependencies and Requirements\n\n*   **Core Odoo Modules:** `base` (essential for any Odoo module).\n*   **External Libraries:** None. The module will rely exclusively on Odoo's built-in functionalities and standard Python libraries.\n*   **System Requirements:** A running Odoo 18.0 instance with standard dependencies (PostgreSQL, Python 3.10+).\n\n## 2. Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Detailed Feature Descriptions\n\nThe `test_module` will introduce a new core entity called \"Test Record.\" Users will be able to create, view, edit, and manage these records through a dedicated interface.\n\n*   **Test Record Management:**\n    *   **Creation:** Users can create new Test Records, providing a unique name, a description, and assigning a responsible user.\n    *   **Viewing:** Users can view a list of all Test Records (tree view) and detailed information for each record (form view).\n    *   **Editing:** Users can modify the details of existing Test Records.\n    *   **Status Management:** Each Test Record will have a lifecycle defined by its status.\n    *   **Deletion:** Authorized users can delete Test Records.\n\n### 2.2 User Stories and Use Cases\n\n*   **User Story 1: Create a New Test Record**\n    *   **As an Odoo User,** I want to create a new Test Record so that I can document a specific test item or task.\n    *   **Use Case:**\n        1.  User navigates to the \"Test Module\" menu.\n        2.  User clicks \"Create\" in the Test Records list view.\n        3.  User fills in the \"Name\" (mandatory), \"Description,\" and selects a \"Responsible User.\"\n        4.  User saves the record.\n        5.  **Expected Result:** A new Test Record is created with a default status of \"Draft.\"\n\n*   **User Story 2: View Existing Test Records**\n    *   **As an Odoo User,** I want to view a list of all Test Records so that I can quickly see an overview of current items.\n    *   **Use Case:**\n        1.  User navigates to the \"Test Module\" menu.\n        2.  **Expected Result:** A list (tree view) of all accessible Test Records is displayed, showing key information like Name, Status, and Responsible User.\n\n*   **User Story 3: Update a Test Record's Details**\n    *   **As an Odoo User,** I want to modify the details of an existing Test Record so that I can keep its information up-to-date.\n    *   **Use Case:**\n        1.  User selects an existing Test Record from the list view.\n        2.  User clicks \"Edit\" on the form view.\n        3.  User modifies the \"Description\" or changes the \"Responsible User.\"\n        4.  User saves the record.\n        5.  **Expected Result:** The Test Record's details are updated.\n\n*   **User Story 4: Advance a Test Record's Status**\n    *   **As an Odoo User with appropriate permissions,** I want to change the status of a Test Record so that I can track its progress.\n    *   **Use Case:**\n        1.  User selects a Test Record in \"Draft\" status.\n        2.  User clicks the \"Confirm\" button (or changes status via dropdown).\n        3.  **Expected Result:** The Test Record's status changes from \"Draft\" to \"Confirmed.\" Similar transitions for \"Confirmed\" to \"Done\" or \"Cancelled.\"\n\n### 2.3 Business Logic Requirements\n\n*   **Unique Name:** The `name` field of a Test Record must be unique to prevent duplicates.\n*   **Mandatory Fields:** The `name` field is mandatory for creating a Test Record.\n*   **Default Status:** Newly created Test Records will default to the 'Draft' status.\n*   **Status Transitions:**\n    *   `Draft` -> `Confirmed`\n    *   `Confirmed` -> `Done`\n    *   `Confirmed` -> `Cancelled`\n    *   `Done` and `Cancelled` are terminal states (cannot transition further).\n*   **Read-only Fields:** `creation_date` will be automatically set upon creation and cannot be modified by users.\n\n## 3. Technical Specifications\n\n### 3.1 Data Models and Relationships\n\nA new Odoo model will be defined: `test_module.test_record`.\n\n*   **Model Name:** `test_module.test_record`\n*   **Technical Name:** `test.record`\n*   **Fields:**\n    *   `name` (`fields.Char`): The unique name of the test record.\n        *   **Properties:** `string='Test Record Name'`, `required=True`, `unique=True`, `index=True`\n    *   `description` (`fields.Text`): A detailed description of the test record.\n        *   **Properties:** `string='Description'`\n    *   `status` (`fields.Selection`): The current status of the test record.\n        *   **Properties:** `selection=[('draft', 'Draft'), ('confirmed', 'Confirmed'), ('done', 'Done'), ('cancelled', 'Cancelled')]`, `string='Status'`, `default='draft'`, `readonly=True`, `copy=False`, `tracking=True`\n    *   `creation_date` (`fields.Datetime`): The date and time when the record was created.\n        *   **Properties:** `string='Creation Date'`, `default=fields.Datetime.now`, `readonly=True`, `copy=False`\n    *   `responsible_id` (`fields.Many2one`): The Odoo user responsible for this test record.\n        *   **Properties:** `comodel_name='res.users'`, `string='Responsible User'`, `default=lambda self: self.env.user`\n\n### 3.2 Views and User Interface Requirements\n\n*   **Menu Item:**\n    *   A top-level menu item named \"Test Module\" will be created.\n    *   Under \"Test Module,\" a sub-menu item \"Test Records\" will lead to the list view of `test.record` model.\n*   **Tree View (`test_record_tree_view`):**\n    *   Displays a list of `test.record` instances.\n    *   **Visible Columns:** `name`, `status`, `responsible_id`, `creation_date`.\n    *   **Order:** By `name` ascending.\n*   **Form View (`test_record_form_view`):**\n    *   Displays detailed information for a single `test.record`.\n    *   **Layout:**\n        *   Header with status `widget=\"statusbar\"`.\n        *   Main section with `name`, `responsible_id`, `description`.\n        *   Read-only `creation_date` field.\n    *   **Buttons:** Contextual buttons for status transitions (`confirm`, `done`, `cancel`).\n*   **Search View (`test_record_search_view`):**\n    *   Allows searching by `name` and `description`.\n    *   **Filters:** By `status` (e.g., \"Draft\", \"Confirmed\", \"Done\", \"Cancelled\").\n    *   **Group By:** By `status`, `responsible_id`.\n\n### 3.3 Workflow and Process Definitions\n\nThe `test.record` model will implement a simple state machine using the `status` field.\n\n*   **States:** `draft`, `confirmed`, `done`, `cancelled`.\n*   **Transitions:**\n    *   **`draft` -> `confirmed`:** Triggered by a \"Confirm\" button action.\n    *   **`confirmed` -> `done`:** Triggered by a \"Mark as Done\" button action.\n    *   **`confirmed` -> `cancelled`:** Triggered by a \"Cancel\" button action.\n*   **Python Methods for Transitions:**\n    *   `action_confirm()`: Sets status to 'confirmed'.\n    *   `action_done()`: Sets status to 'done'.\n    *   `action_cancel()`: Sets status to 'cancelled'.\n\n### 3.4 API Endpoints (if applicable)\n\nFor this simple test module, no dedicated external API endpoints will be exposed. Standard Odoo RPC (XML-RPC/JSON-RPC) will be available for CRUD operations on the `test.record` model, accessible via Odoo's default API.\n\n## 4. Security and Access Control\n\nAccess to `test_module` functionalities and data will be strictly controlled through Odoo's group-based security system.\n\n### 4.1 User Groups and Permissions\n\nTwo new security groups will be defined:\n\n*   **Test / User (`group_test_user`):**\n    *   **Access Rights:**\n        *   `test.record`: Read, Create, Write (update).\n        *   Cannot delete `test.record`.\n        *   Cannot change `status` to `done` or `cancelled`.\n*   **Test / Manager (`group_test_manager`):**\n    *   **Inherits:** Permissions from `group_test_user`.\n    *   **Access Rights:**\n        *   `test.record`: Read, Create, Write, Delete.\n        *   Can change `status` to any valid state (`draft`, `confirmed`, `done`, `cancelled`).\n\n### 4.2 Security Rules and Access Rights\n\n*   **Model Access Records (`ir.model.access.csv`):**\n    *   Grant appropriate CRUD access to `test.record` for `group_test_user` and `group_test_manager`.\n*   **Record Rules (`ir.rule`):**\n    *   No specific record rules (e.g., multi-company, multi-user owner) are required for this simple module, meaning users will see all records they have access to based on their group. If specific record visibility is needed in the future (e.g., users only see records they are `responsible_id` for), this section would be updated.\n*   **Field-level Security:**\n    *   The `status` field's `readonly` attribute will be dynamically controlled based on the user's group and the current status. For instance, `done` or `cancelled` records might be read-only for all users, or only managers can change status to `done`/`cancelled`.\n\n### 4.3 Data Privacy Considerations\n\n*   **Data Minimization:** Only essential data for Test Records (name, description, status, responsible user) will be stored.\n*   **Access Control:** Access to Test Records will be restricted to authorized users through the defined security groups.\n*   **Sensitive Data:** No personally identifiable information (PII) beyond the `res.users` reference for `responsible_id` will be stored within this module's own models. Standard Odoo privacy features for `res.users` will apply.\n\n## 5. Configuration and Settings\n\n### 5.1 Module Configuration Options\n\n*   **Global Settings:** For this simple module, no specific global configuration options are anticipated in Odoo's `Settings` menu. All configurations are handled via security groups and model definitions.\n*   **Default Values:** `test.record` will default to `status='draft'` and `responsible_id` to the current user.\n\n### 5.2 System Parameters\n\nNo custom system parameters (`ir.config_parameter`) are required for this module.\n\n### 5.3 Installation and Setup Requirements\n\n*   **Standard Odoo Module Installation:** The module will be installed like any other Odoo module:\n    1.  Place the `test_module` directory within Odoo's `addons` path.\n    2.  Update the Odoo modules list (Developer Mode -> Update Apps List).\n    3.  Search for \"Test Module\" in the Apps menu.\n    4.  Click \"Install.\"\n*   **Post-Installation:**\n    *   Users will need to be assigned to the `Test / User` or `Test / Manager` security groups to access the module's functionalities.\n\n## 6. Testing Strategy\n\nA comprehensive testing strategy will be employed to ensure the module's stability, functionality, and adherence to requirements.\n\n### 6.1 Unit Testing Scenarios\n\n*   **Model Creation and Field Defaults:**\n    *   Verify that a new `test.record` can be created programmatically.\n    *   Confirm `status` defaults to 'draft' and `creation_date` is set correctly.\n    *   Verify `responsible_id` defaults to the current user.\n*   **Unique Name Validation:**\n    *   Attempt to create a second `test.record` with the same `name` as an existing one and verify it raises a `ValidationError`.\n*   **Status Transitions:**\n    *   Test `action_confirm()`: Verify status changes from 'draft' to 'confirmed'.\n    *   Test `action_done()`: Verify status changes from 'confirmed' to 'done'.\n    *   Test `action_cancel()`: Verify status changes from 'confirmed' to 'cancelled'.\n    *   Test invalid transitions (e.g., `draft` to `done`, `done` to `confirmed`) and ensure they are prevented.\n*   **Access Rights (Programmatic Test):**\n    *   Create a user with `group_test_user` and verify they cannot delete records.\n    *   Create a user with `group_test_user` and verify they cannot change status to `done` or `cancelled`.\n    *   Create a user with `group_test_manager` and verify full CRUD and status change capabilities.\n\n### 6.2 Integration Testing Requirements\n\n*   **Menu and View Accessibility:**\n    *   Verify that the \"Test Module\" and \"Test Records\" menu items are visible to users with assigned groups.\n    *   Confirm that clicking the menu items correctly loads the tree view.\n    *   Verify that opening a record from the tree view correctly loads the form view.\n*   **Search and Filter Functionality:**\n    *   Test searching by `name` and `description`.\n    *   Test filtering by `status` and `responsible_id`.\n*   **User Assignment:**\n    *   Verify that `responsible_id` can be assigned to any active `res.users` record.\n\n### 6.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Criteria\n\nUAT will be performed by end-users to validate the module meets their functional needs.\n\n*   **Core CRUD Operations:**\n    *   Users can successfully create, view, edit, and delete Test Records (if authorized).\n    *   All mandatory fields are enforced during creation.\n*   **Workflow Validation:**\n    *   Users can correctly transition records through the defined workflow states (`draft` -> `confirmed` -> `done`/`cancelled`).\n    *   Unauthorized status changes are prevented.\n*   **UI/UX Usability:**\n    *   The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.\n    *   All fields are clearly labeled and functional.\n    *   Error messages are clear and helpful.\n*   **Security Validation:**\n    *   Users only see and can perform actions on records as per their assigned security groups.\n    *   Users assigned to `Test / User` group cannot delete records or mark them as `done`/`cancelled`.\n    *   Users assigned to `Test / Manager` group have full control over records and status changes.\n\n### 6.4 Performance Testing Considerations\n\nFor a simple module like `test_module`, dedicated performance testing is not a primary concern. However, general Odoo performance best practices will be followed:\n\n*   **Efficient Database Queries:** Avoid N+1 queries. Use ORM methods efficiently.\n*   **Optimized Views:** Keep tree views lean to load quickly.\n*   **Scalability:** The design of the `test.record` model is simple and should scale well for typical Odoo record counts (thousands to tens of thousands) without significant performance degradation. If the module were to handle millions of records or complex computations, specific performance tests (e.g., load testing, query optimization) would be added.\n\n## 7. Deployment and Maintenance\n\n### 7.1 Installation Instructions\n\n*   **Pre-requisites:** Ensure Odoo 18.0 Community or Enterprise edition is installed and running.\n*   **Deployment Steps:**\n    1.  Download the `test_module` directory.\n    2.  Place the `test_module` directory inside your Odoo `addons` path (e.g., `/opt/odoo/custom_addons/`).\n    3.  Restart your Odoo service (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart odoo`).\n    4.  Log in to Odoo as an administrator.\n    5.  Activate Developer Mode (if not already active).\n    6.  Navigate to `Apps` menu.\n    7.  Click \"Update Apps List\" (if the module doesn't appear immediately).\n    8.  Search for \"Test Module\".\n    9.  Click the \"Install\" button for \"Test Module\".\n*   **Post-Installation:**\n    1.  Navigate to `Settings` -> `Users & Companies` -> `Users`.\n    2.  Select the desired users.\n    3.  Edit the user and assign them to either `Test / User` or `Test / Manager` group under the \"Application Accesses\" tab.\n    4.  Save the user changes.\n\n### 7.2 Update and Migration Procedures\n\n*   **Module Updates:** When new versions of the `test_module` are released with changes to data models (`_sql_constraints`, new fields) or views, the standard Odoo update mechanism will be used.\n    1.  Replace the existing `test_module` directory with the new version in the `addons` path.\n    2.  Restart the Odoo service.\n    3.  Log in as administrator, go to `Apps`, search for \"Test Module\", and click \"Upgrade\".\n*   **Data Migration:**\n    *   For additive changes (new fields, new views), Odoo's ORM handles schema updates automatically.\n    *   For changes requiring data transformation (e.g., modifying existing data based on new logic, renaming fields), `post_init_hook` or `noupdate=\"True\"` in XML data files (for records that should not be overwritten) will be used as per Odoo best practices. For this simple module, no complex data migration is anticipated.\n\n### 7.3 Backup and Recovery Considerations\n\n*   **Rely on Odoo's Standard Procedures:** The `test_module` does not introduce any special backup or recovery requirements beyond those for a standard Odoo database.\n*   **Database Backup:** Regular backups of the PostgreSQL database (which contains all Odoo data, including `test_module` records) are crucial.\n*   **Filesystem Backup:** Backup of the Odoo `addons` directory (which includes the `test_module` code) is also recommended.\n*   **Recovery:** In case of data loss, restore the database and filesystem backups to the last known good state. Odoo will automatically synchronize the module code with the database.\n\n---",
